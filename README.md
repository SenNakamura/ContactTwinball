# Contact Twinball

This new type of contact ball is designed for contact juggling. 

It consists of two balls connected by a shaft, allowing for tricks like palm rolls, thanks to the bearings that enable rotation. 

It can also be spun like a pen, making tricks previously impossible in traditional contact juggling achievable.
