# Contact Twinball

This new type of contact ball is designed for contact juggling. 

It consists of two balls connected by a shaft, allowing for tricks like palm rolls, thanks to the bearings that enable rotation. 

It can also be spun like a pen, making tricks previously impossible in traditional contact juggling achievable.

### Tips for Assembly

A pin vise is useful for drilling pilot holes for screws. 

For item 10, recommend to buy longer screws and use a bolt cutter to adjust the length as needed.

Reccomend to use adhesive between screw head of item 10 and item 13
